<h1><strong>Empathy</strong></h1>
<p><strong> What is Empathy? Empathy is my small business the purpose of Empathy
is to give homeless people the basic things needed for survial such as food, 
clothes, shelter, etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem Worth Solving</strong> Homeless people can't afford to
buy food, clothing, a house, etc. It's hard to watch homeless people
on the streets, sometimes with kids begging for money. They need a safe
place to live, they don't have shelter and sometimes they don't even
have clothes. Most of the time homeless people have to dig in
the garbage to find certain things they need. They're always worried about
where the next meal is coming from if it's even a meal and
how they're going to afford that meal.</p>
